I curate trending content at Snap Inc. and develop viral campaigns that consistently generate millions of views and attract tens of thousands of new followers. My portfolio showcases how I've boosted viewership by 90% through strategic short-form storytelling across brands like Phony Texts, Collider, and StockX. I combine creative narrative techniques with data-driven insights to create content that resonates with Gen Z and Millennial audiences while delivering measurable results. My website reflects this approachâ€”clean, purposeful, and focused on showcasing content that people actually want to watch.
